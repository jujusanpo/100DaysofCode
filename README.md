# 100DaysofCode
Round 1
My first attempt at 100 days of code: code for an hour daily.

# Plan (draft):
Get good at using my stack
DSA!!
Complete my bootcamp, to work on the backend for my project.

# Additional Rules:
Rapid log daily to ensure the commit is created.
If code is written by me, and not a template, then it must be committed to a repo, and linked into the day's log.
Course practice is valid, however, completed projects should be uploaded to the repo, linked in the day's rapid log.
1 skip every 2 weeks.

# Goals:
Trying to be a creator, not a consumer. However, this must not affect my learning zone needs.
If I'm making a project, make it public.
